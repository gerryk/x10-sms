A tool to pull SMS messages from a USB GSM interface, parse them for command strings and either push the commands to the X10 interface or collect X10 relay status information and return a status SMS.

So far, there is little validation of incoming SMS and no checking to see if the X10 commands have actually been accepted.

Further enhancements would be to do an X10 search initially and check teh found devices against the configuration.
